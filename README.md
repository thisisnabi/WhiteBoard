# WhiteBoard
Real-time whiteboard based on SignalR .NET 8

The Whiteboard app is a real-time collaborative drawing application built using SignalR. It allows multiple users to interact with a shared virtual whiteboard to draw, write, and share ideas in real-time. As users sketch or add content, all changes are instantly broadcasted to every connected participant, ensuring a seamless, live collaboration experience. SignalR handles real-time communication, enabling low-latency updates across clients, whether for brainstorming sessions, design discussions, or educational purposes. The app also supports multiple device connections, ensuring real-time synchronization regardless of the platform.
